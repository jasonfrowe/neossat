To combine the medfit library:
f2py3 -c utils/medfit.pyf utils/medfit.f90


NEOSSat is a 15-cm optical space telescope capable of obtaining uninterupted time-series imaging of relatively bright stars.  The codes provided here enable corrections of instrumental effects, primarly dark current and tools for rudimentary extraction of aperature photometry.  

There are two versions of the code. A pure Fortran version and a pure Python version.  The Fortran version is stable and optimized.  However, there is a large segment of the community that would prefer an easily portable Python code.  The Python version is not well optimized as it is a translation of the Fortran algorithms, thus many loops need to be 'Pythonized' to significantly reduce overhead.  Run times for the Python code to correct and extract photometry for a single 1Kx1K frame is approximately 2 minutes on a low-power (laptop) i5 CPU.  The Fortran code completes in a few seconds.  The Python version will be further developed to increase speed, but also serves as a well documented procedure to follow when working with NEOSSat imaging.

If you are using Python, I recommend starting with the NEOSSat_template Jupyter/iPython worksheet which depends on neossatlib.py.  If you wish to use the Fortran version, you need to edit the Makefile to match your computer configuration.  The Fortran code requires PGPlot libraries for graphics.  The phot.py Python script demonstrates how to use the Fortran binaries to extract time-series photometry.
